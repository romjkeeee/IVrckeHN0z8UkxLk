## Instructions for Setting Up the Backend Server and Accessing the Landing Page

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   In the `backend-node` folder, you'll need to install the necessary Node.js packages. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the `backend-node` folder, then run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install express body-parser cors
   ```

   This command will install Express.js for building the server and the Body Parser middleware for parsing incoming requests.

3. **Start the Server:**

   In the `backend-node` folder, you can start the Node.js server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   You should see a message indicating that the server is running on a specific port (e.g., "Server is running on port 3000").

4. **Access the Landing Page:**

   Open your web browser index.html page. You should see the landing page.

These steps will set up the backend server and allow you to access the landing page locally. Enjoy exploring the project!
